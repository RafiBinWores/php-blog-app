    <h3 class="mt-5"> Our mission: Making career change universally accessible and effective.</h3>

    <h5 class="mt-5">What does it mean to make career change universally accessible and effective?</h5>
    <p>We believe that talent is equally distributed—regardless of location, identity, background, or experience—but opportunity is not. We want to change that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We imagine a world where anyone on the planet can forge a career they love, and we’re building a human-centric online education experience to achieve exactly that. We come to work every day, passionate about making successful career change possible for more people today than it was yesterday.</p>


    <h5 class="mt-5">We aim to make career change universally accessible:</h5>
    <p>
        1. To anyone who can’t afford to quit their job while they train for their new career <br>
        2. To anyone who doesn’t have access to a university <br>
        3. To anyone who needs to study on a flexible schedule
    </p>


    <p>We know that career change means more than a change in your job title and a salary increase. These things matter, but we go the extra mile to ensure that our students have everything they need to build careers that afford them purpose, autonomy, and creativity—ultimately landing jobs that genuinely improve their quality of life. This is what drives us to keep honing and perfecting everything we do, every day.
